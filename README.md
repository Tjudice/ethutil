# Ethutil: EVM-Compatable Utility Packages for Ethereum
Ethutil provides on the go, easy to use packages and types for interacting with EVM-compatable blockchains. The goal of Ethutil is to expand access to blockchain data by providing interfaces for blockchain data collection and analysis. 

# Packages

[Sprint](https://github.com/Tjudice/ethutil/tree/master/sprint) - Collect and Maintain Up-To-Date Event Logs With Reorg Healing And Programmable Collection Schemas (Soon to be replaced)
[Multicaller](https://github.com/Tjudice/ethutil/tree/master/multicaller) - Interface for making multi calls to improve contract state collection

# Planned
[Fetching](https://github.com/Tjudice/ethutil/tree/master/fetching) - Provides interfaces for more efficient maintainability of chain state, without the need to run an archive node 

**Tracking** - Trace interactions between addresses, contracts, tokens, and more

**Listening** - Interface for adding event listeners to on-chain state changes
